Make Password Protected ZIP

This is an Apple Automator Service. It executes an AppleScript which presents the user a series of dialog boxes which take the user through the process of creating a password protected ZIP file.

This was based on a previous scrip I found in a user forum but has been heavily improved and many issues fixed. This version supports ziping a single file, or an entire folder of files.

Under newer versions of macOS you will likely have to give the automator service permission to work i.e. permission to access files and folders.

To use it, you install it as an automator service as normal. It will then show up in the Finder's services sub-menu. This is accessed by right-clicking on the file or folder you wish to make a password protected ZIP of and then selecting the service from the sub-menu.
